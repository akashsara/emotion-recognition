# Adaptive Content Generation using Facial Recognition and Deep Learning

Project developed by **Akash Saravanan** and **Gurudutt Perichetla** for SVCE Innovates 2018.

### Instructions

* Notebooks 1 through 4 details our progress from preprocessing that data, exploring it, creating models from it and implementing the model.

* The last notebook contains all the other models that we used including the ones we discarded while tuning the hyperparameters.

Dataset used: [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge)

Dataset is freely available and the code may be run locally if you have the 'fer2013.csv' file. Feel free to use our work in yours but do credit us ;)
